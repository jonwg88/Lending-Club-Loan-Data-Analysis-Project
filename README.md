# Lending Club Loan Data Analysis Project

## Project Description

This assignment was to create a model that predicts whether a loan will be default using historical data. The dataset was purposefully highly imbalanced and contained features intended to make the assignment more challenging. 

Participants had to perform data preprocessing to improve the intentionally problematic dataset. Then, a deep learning model prediction was built and trained using Keras with TensorFlow backend.

## Project Features

* Categorical variables were transformed into numerical values using one-hot encoding.
* Exploratory data analysis of different factors of the dataset was performed.
* The dataset was subjected to additional feature engineering meant to detect and remove strongly-correlated features.
* The predictive model was built and trained in Python with CNN architecture.
* After extensive tinkering, the model yielded a loss value of 0.4290 and an accuracy score of 0.8408 for the test dataset.
* The project received a passing grade and positive remarks from the instructor.
